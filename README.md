SiLidi is a website that was made for the final submission in one of my university's subject (RPL : Implementasi dan Pengujian Perangkat Lunak). SiLidi provides a platform for user to buy and sell their "Lidi" handcraft. SiLidi is a fully functional website (Front-End & Back-End) but this repository only provides the Front-End part of SiLidi. In the Front-End development, SiLidi utilize Tailwind for the interface building.
